# 💫 About Me:

[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?color=%fff&size=22&vCenter=true&lines=Hello+There!+;I'm+Cenk+Şengünlü...;)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

I’m a software engineer specializing in building single-page and server-side applications with React and Next.js. I have hands-on experience with Tailwind, Shadcn UI, Material UI, and Chakra UI, allowing me to create clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. I’m passionate about programming and problem-solving, and I’m motivated by seeing the real-world impact of the products I build.

I implement Figma designs into working products, ensuring consistent performance across devices. I enjoy collaborating with teams, keeping projects organized, and aligning efforts toward shared goals. I want to hone my skills within a team I could lead and guide with my accumulated experience.

In past projects, I’ve built scalable interfaces that supported thousands of users and helped optimize performance across platforms. I stay current with front-end development trends and continuously work on improving my skills to deliver efficient, maintainable solutions that users love and businesses rely on.
