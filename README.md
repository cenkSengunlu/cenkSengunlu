# 💫 About Me:

[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?color=%fff&size=22&vCenter=true&lines=Hello+There!+;I'm+Cenk+Şengünlü...;)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

I'm a software engineer with experience in developing single-page applications using React and server-side applications with Next.js. I have hands-on expertise with Tailwind, ShadCN UI, Material-UI, and Chakra UI, which allows me to build clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.

I’m skilled at turning Figma UI/UX designs into code and making sure everything works smoothly across different devices. I’m organized, detail-oriented, and always looking for ways to improve. I enjoy working in teams and making sure we’re all aligned and moving toward the same goals.

I believe in keeping up with the latest trends in front-end development and constantly improving my skills to create better, more efficient solutions.
